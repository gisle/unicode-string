   Release 0.03

   Renamed 'map8.c' to 'map8x.c' because some bad systems would
   overwrite it with 'Map8.c'.

   Attach mapper using magic.  The Unicode::Map8 object is now a
   plain HASH.  That should help when subclassing.

   Support mapping using callback methods.  One one-to-one mapping
   supported by the callbacks yet.
