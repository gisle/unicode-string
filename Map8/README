Unicode::Map8
-------------

The Unicode::Map8 class implement efficient mapping tables between
8-bit character sets and 16 bit character sets like Unicode.  Quite a
number of mapping tables between various known character sets and
Unicode is distributed with this package.  The source of these tables
is the vendor mapping tables provided by Unicode, Inc. and the tables
found in RFC 1345.  New maps can easily be installed.

EXAMPLE OF USE

   require Unicode::Map8;
   $no_map = Unicode::Map8->new("ISO646-NO") || die;
   $l1_map = Unicode::Map8->new("latin1") || die;

   my $ustr = $no_map->to16("V}re norske tegn b|r {res");
   my $lstr = $l1_map->to8($ustr);
   print "$lstr\n";


INSTALLATION

You should first install the Unicode perl module. Once this is
accomplished you just perform the usual steps:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
